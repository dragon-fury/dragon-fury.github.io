# events.ally

events.ally uses Eventbrite API data over a month to create an interactive data visualization on the events.
The distribution of events over 7 days of a week and 24 hours a day for a given month is visualized as a heatmap.
The tiles in the heatmap can be clicked to view details of the events on that specific time period.
